# About

Compliment your learning using the power of OpenAI's GPT.

Whilst powerful, GPT (3.5-turbo to be exact) is limited by the amount of data it can process and it's timed training data. GPT-4 does address the data processing limitation,
thanks to it's 32K token capability but it's access to data is still limited and not under our control. 

This is what Study Smart AI is trying to solve, we're bridging the gap of the "data" and we're doing it by improving the prompt with context. 

# Features (planned)
- Upload text books (pdfs) and get the app to answer any of your questions
- generate set of flash cards from the textbook
